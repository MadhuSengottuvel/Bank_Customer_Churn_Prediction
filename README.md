The purpose of this project is to develop and design an effective and efficient model for customer churn prediction in banking sectors.
The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for the banks. Furthermore, it is always more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than
it is to retain a current paying customer.

The Algorithms chosen for modelling are
  Logistic Regression
  Support Vector Machine with RBF Kernel
  Support Vector Machine with Poly Kernel
  Random Forest Classifier
  XG Boost Classifier

By using ROC curve for the above five models, we have concluded that the best alogrithm suited for our model is RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER

For Web Deployment we have used Flask Framework and pickle library.

In Conclusion, Although all the models yield similar results, the theoretical reasons and theoretical considerations are different.
The overall best performing model to predict bank customer churn is Random Forest Classifier. This is due its overall performance for all the evaluation measurements and computational efficiency.

Our WedApp will predict whether any customer will be churned or not churned. Once we know abuot the customers who are on the verge of leaving the association, then we can use various promotional strategies targeted to impress or improve our relation with that customer thus by reducing the bank churn rate.
